User can add bookmarks to their bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:
    title
    url link
    description
    rating (1-5)

User can see a list of their bookmarks when they first open the app
    All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating

User can click on a bookmark with the icon "+" to show the "detailed" view
    click "close" to close the detail view
    Detailed view expands to show description and a "Visit Site" link

User can remove bookmarks from their bookmark list

Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. title and url field required)

User can select from a dropdown (a <select> element) a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection
